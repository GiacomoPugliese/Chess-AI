# Chess-AI

Utilized polymorphic patterns in Java to recreate a virtual game of chess with graphics supported by the Java Swing and Java AWT libraries. Created an artificial intelligence to play the game, that sees mutliple turns ahead and utilizes a minimax algorithm to play accurate moves. Implemented alpha beta pruning to make the algorithm faster, and custom board evaluation heuristics to optimize the bots control of the center and endgame tactics.
